"Comic.NET":http://comic.lordabdul.net and "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile allows you to add a few things to your webcomic:

	* Some simple little news items like this
	** Yep! Even nested lists!
	* In which you can *format* stuff
	* (among _other_ things)
	
This is really groovy.
